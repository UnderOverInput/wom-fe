# How to Read and Use the Tweet Sentiment Chart

Welcome to the Tweet Sentiment Chart Guide. Understanding sentiment shifts in real-time can give you a serious edge in crypto trading. Here's how to make the most of it.

---

## What the Chart Shows
- Each token is displayed horizontally.
- Vertical boxes represent the distribution of sentiment over the last 24 hours.
- Key metrics:
  - Maximum: Most bullish individual sentiment.
  - Q3: The top 25% of sentiment.
  - Median: The middle point of sentiment.
  - Q1: The bottom 25% of sentiment.
  - Minimum: Most bearish individual sentiment.

The closer the median and Q3 are to 1.0, the more overwhelmingly positive the market feels.

---

## How to Read It

- High Median, Tight Range:
  - Sentiment is strong and consensus is tight. No big emotional swings = more stable climb potential.
- Low Median, Wide Range:
  - Divided crowd. Some love it, some hate it. Good for short-term volatility traders.
- High Maximum but Low Median:
  - A few loud bulls are screaming, but the crowd isn't convinced yet. Approach with caution.
- High Q1:
  - Even the most bearish takes aren't *that* bearish. That’s powerful for resilience.

## Example Dummy Chart

Token     | Min | Q1  | Median | Q3  | Max
--------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | ---
$MOONCOIN | 0.2 | 0.45| 0.6    | 0.75| 0.95
$FUDCOIN  | 0.1 | 0.25| 0.4    | 0.6 | 0.9
$SLEEPY   | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.5    | 0.55| 0.65

Interpretation:
- $MOONCOIN shows strong bullishness with wide positive spread. Momentum potential.
- $FUDCOIN is divisive: could pump or dump hard.
- $SLEEPY is stable but might lack the fire to breakout.

## Understanding Yellow Dots on the Sentiment Chart

In the Tweet Sentiment Chart, you might notice yellow dots appearing above or below the main boxplots. Here's what they represent:

- Yellow Dots = Outliers
  - These are points outside of the normal sentiment distribution range.
  - They reflect individual tweet sentiments that are significantly more positive or negative than the bulk of tweets.

### What It Means:
- High Yellow Dots:
  - Extremely positive sentiment tweets.
  - Indicates potential viral or emotional reactions.
- Low Yellow Dots:
  - Extremely negative sentiment tweets.
  - Usually some fud that could start catching on.

### Why It Matters:
- If you see many yellow dots *above* the normal range, it means there is unusually strong bullish chatter.
- A lack of Yellow dots *below* the range suggests minimal extreme bearishness.

### Quick Takeaway
- Yellow Dots = Extreme Sentiment Events
- More (especially bullish) outliers often hint at emotional/viral posts that can precede major price movements—either up or down.

Use these insights alongside the rest of the chart to spot hidden momentum before the market reacts.

## 3 Advanced Sentiment Plays

1. **The Hidden Divergence Play**\
   If sentiment improves but price lags behind, it’s a potential breakout loading.

2. **The Sentiment Compression Play**\
   When the boxplot becomes abnormally tight (small spread between Q1 and Q3), expect a violent move soon — bullish or bearish.

3. **The Early Pivot Play**\
   If sentiment bottoms out (low minimums) and Q1 starts moving higher while price stagnates, you’re likely spotting the bottom early.

## Why This Matters
In an environment where attention dictates price action, being able to read crowd psychology before it’s obvious gives you a serious advantage. The Tweet Sentiment Chart isn’t just a nice visualization. It's an *early warning system* for traders who know where to look.

Stay sharp, stay ahead.

## Pro Tip
Combine sentiment insights with liquidity tracking and supply data for even deadlier accuracy.
